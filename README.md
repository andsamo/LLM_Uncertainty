### LLM_Uncertainty

This project presents LLMs with series of subjective/ hard-to-verify problems and asks the model to self-evaluate their certainty in the response. At the same time, we compare more objective, mechanistic certainty estimates derived from logprobs (i.e., perplexity, linear prob, entropy).
